### Setting up the repository
  - Once you clone the repo to your personal computer, go to the directory via command line and enter the following commands:

  - `npm install`
<br>


### Prerequisites to starting the application via simulator
Windows:
  - ensure you have installed JDK8/android studio/android device simulator.
  - you will not be able to simulate on ios so do not worry about that.

  - ensure you have xCode installed for ios simulation.

### Starting the simulator:
  - go to the the docTRA home directory via command line, and type `expo start`
  - this will launch a local host browser instance where metro bundler will allow you to launch simulations for testing.
  - just google any errors that come up in your terminal if expo doesn't launch - there are plenty of guidance on how to fix these issues.
