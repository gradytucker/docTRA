### prerequisites to starting the application via simulator

  - ensure you have xCode installed for ios simulation.


### Starting the simulator:
  - go to the the docTRA home directory via command line, and type `expo start`

  - just google any errors that come up in your terminal if expo doesn't launch - there are plenty of guidance on how to fix these issues.
