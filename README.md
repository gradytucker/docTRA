### Setting up the repository
  - Once you clone the repo to your personal computer, go to the directory via command line and enter the following commands:
  - `npm install -g expo-cli`
  - `npm install`
 
  - expo handles all react-native components so you should not have to worry about anything else.

### Starting the simulator:
  - go to the the docTRA home directory via command line, and type `expo start`
  - this will launch a local host browser instance where metro bundler will allow you to launch simulations for testing.
  - just google any errors that come up in your terminal if expo doesn't launch - there are plenty of guidance on how to fix these issues.
