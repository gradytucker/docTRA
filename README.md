  - The aim of this project is to develop a software platform that will assist doctors and those in medical professions to deal and manage their day-to-day emotional stresses. It has been shown in both past attempts and current available strategies that training is critical to a doctorâ€™s professional development and success. However, what makes the effectiveness of doctor training so critical is the fact that the training itself must not be perceived as a burden to those partaking in it, and the purpose of the training must be fully justified and understood by the participants.

  - We aim to develop an application platform that provides targeted information to doctors as a supplementary reinforcement tool to their face-to-face training. This application will provide doctors with exercises, videos, guides and reminders relating to their stress and well-being management. The application will provide users the ability to provide and share anonymous feedback, and the effectiveness of the application will be measured via  usage data, triggered use rating and said anonymous feedback.

  - This application is intended to be cross platform and be available on a variety of mobile operating systems. Full development, realization, and testing of the project commencing early next semester, with the utilization of a modified waterfall methodology with overlapping phases as its project model.
We plan to introduce this application as part of the common humanity training at Epworth HealthCare that will take place in July 2021, and the application will be introduced and utilised for 6 weeks after their initial common humanity training sessions.

### Development requirements:
  - Node.js
  - npm
<br>


### Setting up the repository
  - Once you clone the repo to your personal computer, go to the directory via command line and enter the following commands:
  - `npm install -g expo-cli`
  - `npm install`
 
  - expo handles all react-native components so you should not have to worry about anything else.

### Prerequisites to starting the application via simulator
Windows:
  - ensure you have installed JDK8/android studio/android device simulator.

Mac:
  - ensure you have installed JDK8/android studio/android device simulator.
  - ensure you have xCode installed for ios simulation.
<br>


### Starting the simulator:
  - go to the the docTRA home directory via command line, and type `expo start`
  - this will launch a local host browser instance where metro bundler will allow you to launch simulations for testing.
  - just google any errors that come up in your terminal if expo doesn't launch - there are plenty of guidance on how to fix these issues.
